           I write, produce and perform electropop under the name Deerful. I have released two singles and two EPs on independent labels Where It's At Is Where You Are and Gare Du Nord, and released an album, <i>Peach</i> in the spring/summer of 2017, which received praise from the Guardian and Clash Music, amongst others. I also maintain a YouTube channel with a small following focused upon songwriting, production, and live performance.

        I contributed the electropop track 'Break' to major UK charity Centrepoint's digital campaign <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0epwLTzFgJg">'Young and Homeless: Your Phone Tells The Story'</a>, which received <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/15/video-shows-the-heartbreaking-choices-homeless-people-face-every-day-6450902/?ito=facebook">coverage in the Metro</a>.</p>
<br/>
        <p>I also contributed the tracks 'Strength In A Storm', 'A Hopeful Moment', 'A Spark of Joy', 'Early Riser', and 'Teatime Shuffle', co-written and co-produced with Donal Scott, to the Clearwave production library's album <a href="http://www.clearwavemusic.com/music/cwm0057-simply-ukueles"><i>Simply Ukuleles</i></a>, using my knowledge of the advertising market for ukulele music gained from my thesis work.</p>

        <p>I have since produced a full album for production library use in the chiptune genre.</p>

        I create and self-release audio collages using found sounds in various locations as abstract documents of spaces, places and events. In January 2016 I also produced and released the EP <em>Browser Pieces</em>, using only web browser-based synthesisers, in a single evening.
