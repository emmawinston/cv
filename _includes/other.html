            A series of bots using the Twitter framework to automate artistic or humorous content, programmatically generated in the Tracery library or in Python. My primary bot project is Graphic Score Bot, which generates graphic scores to inspire experimental musicians, and which was premiered in a live performance at Somerset House in April 2016.

            I contributed Python code to sound artists <a href="http://lendl.ca/">|end|</a> and Annie Goh's installation, |dis|quiÉTUDE, which will be shown at St James Hatcham Church in southeast London. The code taps into Twitter streams which can be specified either by retweeted user or by specific search terms or hashtags, extracts numerical data from their associated follower counts, likes, and permalinks, and passes that data to Supercollider via the Open Sound Control protocol.
