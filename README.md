# Vitae

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/biomadeira/vitae.png?branch=gh-pages)](http://travis-ci.org/biomadeira/vitae)

Personal homepage (curriculum vitae or resume) based on [Jo√£o's](https://github.com/joaomoreno/resume).
Vitae is built with [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and freely
hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Issues and contributing 

I have tested this install with Ruby v2.2.2p95 (Mac OS RVM) and Jekyll v3.0.0. If you run into any problems please log them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/biomadeira/vitae/issues).

Feel free pull-request your patches and fixes.
